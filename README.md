# Polar vortex visualization

A quick visualization of the leadup to the 2019 polar vortex, using [GFS minimum temperature forecast data](ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/GIS/gfs_0.25/) from NOAA.

Inspired by the inimitable [Tim Wallace](https://twitter.com/wallacetim/status/1090274050054619136).

## Usage

`./make.sh`

That should be it, assuming you have all the dependencies installed.

## Other notes

See further documentation in the [goes16-eboni](https://github.com/cjdd3b/goes16-eboni) and [snowfall-montage](https://github.com/cjdd3b/snowfall-montage) repos.

This project follows more or less the same pattern.
